# Ethereum Playground 

Ethereum playground is a simple batteries-included development environment with all the tools needed pre-installed. 

There are two options. You can run a Virtualbox VM and build a dev environment using Vagrant or use Docker containers provided by the ethereum project to bootstrap your development environment. The docker container is preferred.

[Setup environment with Docker](README_Docker.md)
